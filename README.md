This repository was created for personal use only and is not being maintained,
this is why it does not contain a user guide.
It is also not written in a 'coherent' way as it was one of my very first projects.

# BinanceTradingBot
Create strategies, backtest (based on the data that can be downloaded using the script) them and visualise this with use of plotly.
Keep in mind that there are no actual functions that allow you to buy/sell real time.

## After spending some time I figured out that written strategies do not make profit consistently due to (relatively) low validity.

# Before use 
Make sure the dependencies are installed.
Create binance_keys.py and add your api keys 
The last step is only needed for downloading the data from Binance.
